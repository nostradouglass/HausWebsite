Haus' mission is to develop natural medicines using an evidenced-based approach. Haus’s highly integrated R&D team is comprised of multidisciplinary experts in the fields of naturopathic and allopathic medicine, immunology, and inflammatory biology, and early-stage brand development and commercialization. Haus utilizes state of the art laboratories for lead compound identification, mechanism of action studies, and preclinical assessments. In addition, Haus has an active clinical trial program to identify indications and to quantify efficacy and safety profiles relative to current standards of care. Clinically active botanicals are put through the same rigorous development process as pharmaceutical medicines, bridging the worlds of pharmacologic and naturopathic medicine. This is a unique approach, a third path, where the full potential and mechanisms of action of these natural safe and effective anti-inflammatory treatments is being understood and harnessed in an evidenced-based manner for the first time.</p><p>Technologies appropriate for the OTC space are developed into proto-brands by crowdsourcing consumer’s requirements on the largest online commercial channel (Amazon.com) and social media advertising, which is further supported by bioceutical-specific regulatory strategies. Ultimately, technologies and proto-brands are licensed to leading channel partners in the consumer products and professional spaces. In addition to “in-haus” programs, Haus establishes co-development partnerships with other companies.</p><p>Haus has completed preclinical and clinical development of our first technology and proto-brand, “MetaDerm”, a proprietary combination herbal-based treatment for chronic inflammatory skin diseases including eczema and psoriasis with unmatched efficacy and safety</p></div><h5><a href="#">Contact Us</a></h5></div></div><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"><div class="founders"><h2>Meet the Founders</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-8"><img src="/images/mike_bio_300x300_large.jpg"></div><div class="col-md-5 col-sm-7 col-xs-11"><h3>Dr. Michael Centola</h3><p>Dr. Centola, Ph.D., is the co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Scientific Officer at Haus Bioceuticals—makers of MetaDerm.
